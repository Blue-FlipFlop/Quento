## How Wellness Programs Work

</br>
Wellness programs provide many benefits to both employees and the organizations that host them. They 
come in a variety of forms, but all support more productive and happier workforces, resulting
higher levels of work across the board. 

  Organizations that have realized the benefits of wellness programs in reducing 
stress have seen significant gains in employee happiness and satisfaction. Providing 
amenities to keep the staff happy not only reduces the toll take on the worker's health,
thereby reducing time spent sick, but also provides an unique advantage in the acquiring of new talent.

Examples of wellness programs include:

<ol>
<li>Gym Memberships </li>
<li>Healthy Meals Provided At Work </li>
<li>Training in Life Skills such as Conflict Resolution or Stress Reduction </li>
<li>Professional Activity Days</li>
</ol>
