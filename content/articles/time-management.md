## The Importance of Time Management

</br>

One of the largest contributors to day to day stress, especially in the workplace, is that of deadlines and due dates. It seems like in the modern day, we find ourselves rushing from timeline to timeline, trying to meet an unending flood of workplace 
expectations.

## Strategies
</br>

### 1. Start With the Bigger Picture
    In order to begin to get the most out of your time, each second spent 
    needs to spent with a high level of focus. 
    The first step in achieving this is to identify what you want to focus on.

### 2. Decide what you want *less* of

When thinking about time management, the first thing that most people 
will think of is where they want to spend more time. And this tendency makes
sense, as when you don't have enough time to do what you would want, the 
lack of time sticks out like a sore thumb. However, identifying 
what you want *less* of is just as important, but is
something that once decided upon, is able to be acted upon immediately.

### 3. Make A Plan Every Single Day

&nbsp Right after waking up, before doing anything else, list out at most 2 or 3 things
that *must* happen today. This lets everything else the world throws at you that day
to be filtered in terms of how it will help or hinder in the pursuit of those specific goals.



&nbsp A bird that drifts in whichever direction the wind takes blows will never reach
its destination. Similarly, reacting individually to every stimulus or event over the course 
of a day will only lead to you being exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. Direct the 
course of the day, and you will reach your reach your destination.
