## The Importance of Flexibility

&nbsp Everyone recognizes intuitively that each individual's situation is unique to them,
and that no two employees in an organization share the same set of needs and capabilities.
Yet many workplaces still have by and large a one size fit all approach to 
workplace policy and structure. Differences between individual circumstance and 
workplace expectation can be a major contributor to stress in the workplace. Here are
some examples of such issues, and possible solutions. 

### Congestion & Working Remotely

&nbsp One of the largest headaches that most people living and working in large, urban areas 
have to go through is being stuck in traffic day in and day out for hours on end. Not only
are the employee's hours wasted while sitting in their car or bus, but unpredictable delays
that are out of the control of both employer and employee can cause considerable losses in 
productivity. With the adoption of a remote workplace is forced upon businesses for the 
forseeable future, many will come out of the pandemic realizing the many benefits 
that this setup provides, and will opt to adopt such practices into their workflow
even after quarantine has ended.

### Flexible Hours
</br>

The standard working schedule of 9 - 5, Monday through Friday has been the convention for so long that
the term 9-5 has become a trope of stiff, dragging, unending hours of toil. Yet we all know that 
not everyone is the most productive at the same time. Some people may be early risers, hoping to
get as much done as soon as possible before others are even naturally awake. It is only
this outdated standard that binds all to one singular schedule. Yet out of 
the forwards thinking, innovative business leaders, many have dropped this in favour
of more flexible schedules, including 4 day 10 hour work weeks or offset schedules. 
These measures ensure that the organization is getting the best out of each and every employee.

### Job Sharing or Part Time Accommodation
</br>

In the rapidly developing world, many professionals have shifted to 
more dynamic and adaptive practices that enable them to have the flexibility to 
take advantage of the ever changing set of opportunities before its too late. 
Because of this, the business world has seen an increase in the number of 
freelancers, digital nomads and self-employed professionals looking to be able
to seek out the best opportunities as they see fit. Organizations seeking to
attract new talent or better accommodate and keep their existing employees have
turned to Job Sharing as a solution to be able to find and retain the best and brightest,
while employees may find the self direction and freedom a fulfilling and less stressful alternative
to traditional full time employment.
