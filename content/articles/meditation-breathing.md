## Why Meditation?

</br>
One of the most common symptoms of stress is a looming feeling of being overwhelmed.
It can often feel like there is just too much to do, not enough time to do it, 
and no where to start admist all of the noise to keep track of. In stressful situations,
which often requires us to focus the most, it can feel impossible to concentrate without
being distracted by other pressing issues. 

</br></br>
Meditation can take many forms, but universally call for the meditator's focus to be
directed at one thing - be it a voice, a thought, or in the simplest case, the meditator's
breath itself. This act of letting go of all other thoughts and worries and concentrating one's 
focus lets one temporarily see past one's immediate circumstances to discern truths that were 
previously obscured by the noise of the real world. Concretely, this means that attempting to 
for just a few moments focus uniquely on something other than what is causing stress, you may
be able to gain a new perspective and see solutions that you missed previously, being too caught up in
the pressing issues of life.

## How to Practice Meditation and Deep Breathing?

</br>
&nbsp One of the biggest appealing factors of meditation and deep breathing is their 
universal accessibility. Meditation generally comes in two flavours: guided or unguided.
In guided meditation, as the name suggests, a calming voice will guide you through
the process step by step, while all the listener needs to do is to find a space
and time and follow the recording. There are numerous guided meditation recordings
online, including a large catalogue available for free on sites such as Youtube and Spotify.

</br>

Unguided meditation and breathing exercises require even less set up, and to start
one just needs to find a quiet place in their surroundings. Unguided meditation 
at its simplest involves sitting and paying attention to your body or thoughts over
some period of time, but even just this has proven to provide significant health benefits.

</br>
Meanwhile, one form of breathing exercises involves taking purposeful, deep breaths, in through the nose and 
then releasing out through the mouth. The chemicals your brain produces when responding 
to high stress can unconsciously cause your breathing to be very short and quick. When this happens,
not enough oxygen reaches your brain for you to think clearly, perpetuating the cycle. When you find
yourself with shortness of breath, taking deep, intentional breaths of air can help you clear your mind
to better deal with the situation.
